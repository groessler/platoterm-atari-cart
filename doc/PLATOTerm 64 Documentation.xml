                <title>What is PLATOTerm 64?</title>
                <para>PLATOTerm64 is a Terminal Emulator for your Commodore 64 computer that
                    emulates a PLATO terminal. With PLATOTerm64, you can successfully access such
                    internet-accessible services, such as <link xlink:href="http://www.irata.online/">IRATA.ONLINE</link>, or <link xlink:href="http://www.cyber1.org/">CYBER1.ORG</link>, which are unique
                    services that you can access not only from your Commodore 64, but from many
                    other vintage computers, as well.</para>
                <para>PLATOTerm64 works on any Commodore 64 computer, or Commodore 128 computer
                    running in Commodore 64 mode, and takes advantage of the Commodore 64's 320x200
                    graphics mode to provide the graphical display needed by a PLATO system. All of
                    the keys present on a PLATO terminal are mapped to equivalent keys on the
                    Commodore keyboard, and the PLATO terminal display is resized from its original
                    512x512 size, to fit on the 320x200 display provided by your Commodore 64. The
                    touch display nominally provided by the PLATO terminal is simulated using either
                    a supported mouse, light pen, or touch tablet.</para>

                <title>What is PLATO?</title>
                <para>PLATO, which stood for Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations, was
                    perhaps the first generalized computer assisted instruction system. The project,
                    started in 1960, initially ran on the ILLIAC I computer at the University of
                    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and by the 1970s was supporting several thousand
                    graphical terminals, distributed worldwide, running on nearly a dozen networked
                    mainframe computers. Many innovations were originally developed on PLATO, and
                    the purpose of PLATOTerm, and by extension, PLATO sites like IRATA.ONLINE, and
                    CYBER1.ORG, exist to not only preserve the legacy of PLATO, but to expose its
                    uniqueness to vintage computer users, and give them a unique online
                    destination.</para>
                <para>PLATO environments provide an interactive; graphical environment, that is
                    controlled by both a keyboard and a touch screen, originally to facilitate what
                    was thought to be required for Computer Based training, but was ultimately
                    expanded into many other very unique innovations, due to the combination of
                    unique technology and culture that grew up around the PLATO environment. </para>

                    <title>Knowing more about PLATO History and Culture</title>
                    <para>If you would like to know more about PLATO, as well as its origins and
                        historical impact. You should read Brian Dear's book: <link xlink:href="http://www.friendlyorangeglow.com/">The Friendly Orange
                            Glow: The Untold Story of the PLATO System and the Dawn of
                            Cyberculture</link>. </para>

                <title>Scope of this manual</title>
                <para>This book is intended as an introductory user's guide to both PLATOTerm64, as
                    well as an overview of the two extant PLATO services, <link xlink:href="http://www.irata.online/">IRATA.ONLINE</link> and <link xlink:href="http://www.cyber1.org/">CYBER1.ORG</link>. You will be shown the
                    process of loading and configuring PLATOTerm64, as well as ensuring that you can
                    connect to the two aforementioned services. It is important that you follow the
                    instructions in this manual, to get the best experience you can out of these two
                    services.</para>

                    <title>Corrections?</title>
                    <para>If you have any potential corrections, or otherwise improvements, you can
                        either contact the author, or fork the documentation, make the changes, and
                        issue a pull request on Github, as the documentation is open-source, and in
                        an easy to understand XML format (DocBook 5.1, as of the time of this
                        writing.) Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, your name
                        will be added to the credits of this manual. </para>

            <para>PLATOTerm64 is easy to set up. Once you have finished this chapter, PLATOTerm
                should be running and waiting to be able to connect to a PLATO service.</para>

                                For modern displays, look at using a Commodore cable, connected to
                                an S-Video to HDMI converter.</para>

                                Since the current PLATO systems are connected to the Internet, your
                                Commodore computer will need a wifi modem or Ethernet cartridge
                                connected to an Internet accessible network. As of version 1.0,
                                PLATOTerm64 supports the following devices:<itemizedlist>

                    is the PLATOTERM software, and if you load the * file, you will load the
                    PLATOTerm program.</para>
                <para>To load the PLATOTerm software, insert the disk into your drive. If you're
                    using an SD2IEC or similar, you can either any built in loaders to select the
                    disk image, or you can choose to enter the commands to mount the disk from
                    BASIC.</para>
                <para>Once you've mounted the disk, you can load the software with the following
                    command:<screen>LOAD"*",8,1</screen></para>
                <para>And then the PLATOTerm64 splash screen will become visible, and wait for you

                        like a Hayes™ compatible MODEM, using AT commands to specify not only
                        operating parameters, but to connect to the desired host, as well as to
                        terminate the connection. </para>
                    <para>It does this by taking care of all the TCP/IP duties itself, and providing
                        the resulting extracted data from each TCP/IP packet, over the serial
                        connection. Thus, these serial devices are very beneficial if you wish to
                        use existing terminal programs to connect to hosts on the Internet, without
                        requiring special terminal software. They are also very inexpensive and easy

                    "dial" IRATA.ONLINE. For all of the known internet MODEMs, the following command
                    is sufficient:<userinput>ATDTirata.online:8005</userinput>. This tells the MODEM
                    to connect to the hostname <userinput>irata.online</userinput> port number
                        <userinput>8005</userinput>. When connected, you will see the NOS banner

                <title>The PLATO Keyboard</title>
                <para>PLATO terminals feature a keyboard with many special keys, primarily to aid
                    navigation, but also to access additional special characters that go beyond the
                    standard American character set (such as greek letters and mathematical
                    symbols.) The following chart demonstrates the keyboard mapping shows how the
                    keys on the PLATO keyboard are mapped to keys on the Commodore keyboard. A
                    larger version of this chart is in Appendix A.</para>
